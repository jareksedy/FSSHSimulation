#  FSSHSimulation
File system and shell simulation written in Swift for educational purposes.

## Description
FSSHSimulation is a console app that simulates a generic UNIX shell and filesystem. It was written for my students as an example of Swift object-oriented and protocol capabilities.

To get the list of available commands build, run and type the following:
```sh
cat ~/available_commands
```
Note that the commands may be limited in functionality comparing to those found in the most of UNIX-like operating systems. The purpose of this piece of software was strictly educational. I did not mean to recreate a UNIX shell with full functionality.
